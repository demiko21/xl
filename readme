1)If c | a and c | b, show that c | (a + b).
a=c⋅k , b=c⋅m, a+b=c(k+m)
2. If c | a and c | b, show that c | (a·b)
a=c⋅k,b=c⋅m , ab=(ck)(cm)=c(ckm)
If a | b and c | d, show (a·c) | (b·d).
b=a⋅x,d=c⋅y,bd=(ax)(cy)=(ac)(xy),
If a | b and b ≠ 0, show |a| ≤ |b|.
b=a⋅k,
If k = ±1, |a| = |b|
If |k| ≥ 2, |b| is bigger than |a|.
So |a| can never be bigger than |b|.
2)For any integers a, b (b>0), show there exists unique q such that
0≤a−qb<b,
a=bq+r,0≤r<b, r=a−qb
r is always unique.
Division always gives a unique quotient q and remainder r.
b)If gcd(a,b)=g, prove that a/g and b/g are relatively prime.
Easy explanation:
If g = gcd(a,b), then g is the biggest number that divides both a and b.
Divide both by g:
a/g, b/g
There is no number >1 that divides them both, because if there was,
then a and b would have a bigger gcd than g → impossible.
3)3k,3k+1,3k+2
(3k)2=9k2=3(3k2) → form 3m
(3k+1)2=9k2+6k+1=3(3k2+2k)+1 → form 3m+1
(3k+2)^2=9k2+12k+4=3(3k2+4k+1)+1
b)3k,3k+1,3k+2
(3k)3=27k3=9(3k3)→ 9k
(3k+1)3=27k3+27k2+9k+1=9m+1 → 9k+1
(3k+2)3=27k3+54k2+36k+8=9m+8 → 9k+8
4)Show irem(a·m + b, m) = irem(b, m)
Why (easy): a·m is a multiple of m so it leaves remainder 0. Adding b doesn’t change the remainder.
Answer: irem(a·m + b, m) = irem(b,m).
Show irem(a + b + c, m) = irem(a + irem(b+c,m), m)
Why (easy): First reduce b+c to its remainder r = irem(b+c,m). Then b+c = m·t + r. So a+b+c = a + m·t + r and remainder = remainder of a+r.
Answer: irem(a+b+c,m) = irem(a + irem(b+c,m), m).
Show irem(a+b, m) = irem( irem(a,m) + irem(b,m), m)
Why (easy): Replace a and b by their remainders ra and rb. Then a+b = m·k + (ra+rb), so final remainder is remainder of ra+rb.
Answer: irem(a+b,m) = irem(irem(a,m)+irem(b,m), m).
