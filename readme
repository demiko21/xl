1. Genus / species — identify which is which, then name two other species of the same genus (5 pts)

a) RABBIT, ANIMAL

Genus: Animal

Species: Rabbit

Two other species (same genus): Dog, Horse

b) LION, PREDATOR

Genus: Predator (a predator is a broader category)

Species: Lion

Two other species (same genus/category “predator”): Tiger, Wolf

c) BASEBALL, SPORT

Genus: Sport

Species: Baseball

Two other species (same genus): Soccer, Basketball

d) GARMENT, COAT

Genus: Garment

Species: Coat

Two other species (same genus): Shirt, Pants

e) COW, MAMMAL

Genus: Mammal

Species: Cow

Two other species (same genus): Human, Dog

2. Arrange each list in order of increasing abstractness (from most concrete → most abstract) (5 pts)

a) Items: Performer, John Lennon, Singer

Order: John Lennon → Singer → Performer

b) Items: Durable goods, manufactured objects, refrigerator, appliance

Order: Refrigerator → Appliance → Durable goods → Manufactured objects

c) Items: Google, corporation, multinational company, institution

Order: Google → Multinational company → Corporation → Institution

d) Items: Telephone, iPhone, mobile telephone, communication device

Order: iPhone → Mobile telephone → Telephone → Communication device

e) Items: U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, national leader

Order: Thomas Jefferson → U.S. president → National leader

3. For each proposed definition — identify genus and differentia (5 pts)

a) “Snow is the precipitation consisting of flakes or clumps of ice crystals.”

Genus: Precipitation

Differentia: Consisting of flakes or clumps of ice crystals

b) “Numbers are mathematical objects used to count, measure and label.”

Genus: Mathematical objects

Differentia: Used to count, measure, and label

c) “Rational number is a number in the form of p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.”

Genus: Number

Differentia: Having the form p/q with p and q integers and q ≠ 0

d) “A pen is a hand-held writing implement that uses ink.”

Genus: Hand-held writing implement

Differentia: Uses ink

e) “A tree is a plant with thick roots.”

Genus: Plant

Differentia: Having thick roots

(Nota bene: some differentia could be tightened — e.g. “thick roots” is somewhat vague — but this answers the requested identification.)

4. For each paragraph: does it contain an argument? If yes — state premises and conclusion.

a) “We parked at the trailhead and began our hike up Mt. Washington, walking through a dense forest. After 2 hours we reached the halfway point and stopped to eat lunch.”

Contains an argument? No.

This is a narrative / report of events, not an argument (no premises offered to support a claim).

b) “Cable television can provide the viewer with more channels than broadcast television, and it usually delivers a higher quality picture. For these reasons, the number of cable subscribers will probably continue to grow rapidly.”

Contains an argument? Yes.

Premises: (1) Cable provides more channels than broadcast TV. (2) Cable usually delivers a higher-quality picture.

Conclusion: Therefore, the number of cable subscribers will probably continue to grow rapidly.

c) “It’s important to have sturdy boots for this hike, because the trail is very rocky.”

Contains an argument? Yes.

Premise: The trail is very rocky.

Conclusion: Therefore, it’s important to have sturdy boots for this hike.

d) “Since these peaks are above the tree line, hikers are totally exposed to the weather.”

Contains an argument? Yes (a simple inferential claim / explanatory inference).

Premise: These peaks are above the tree line.

Conclusion: Hikers are totally exposed to the weather.

(This can also be read as an explanation rather than an argument, but it functions as inference from premise → conclusion.)

e) “It is rarely economical for two companies to lay cables in the same area and compete directly. This suggests that cable television is a natural monopoly, which should be regulated by the government.”

Contains an argument? Yes.

Premise: It is rarely economical for two companies to lay cables in the same area and compete directly.

Intermediate inference / sub-conclusion: Cable television is a natural monopoly.

Final conclusion: Therefore, cable television should be regulated by the government.

5. Formal reasoning proofs (show steps)
Problem A

Premises (informal):

It is not sunny this afternoon. — translate: ¬S

We will go swimming only if it is sunny. — translate: Swim → S

If we do not go swimming, then we will take a canoe trip. — translate: ¬Swim → Canoe

If we take a canoe trip, then we will be home by sunset. — translate: Canoe → Home

Goal: conclude Home (We will be home by sunset).

Proof (propositional steps):

¬S. (Premise)

Swim → S. (Premise: “only if” means Swim implies S)

From (1) and (2): by modus tollens we get ¬Swim. (If Swim → S and S is false, then Swim is false.)

¬Swim → Canoe. (Premise)

From (3) and (4): by modus ponens we get Canoe.

Canoe → Home. (Premise)

From (5) and (6): by modus ponens we get Home. ✔

So the premises logically entail “We will be home by sunset.”

Problem B

Premises:

If you send me an e-mail message, then I will finish writing the program. — E → F

If you do not send me an e-mail message, then I will go to sleep early. — ¬E → Sleep

If I go to sleep early, then I will wake up feeling refreshed. — Sleep → R

Goal: show If I do not finish writing the program, then I will wake up feeling refreshed. — i.e. ¬F → R

Proof:

E → F. (Premise)

From (1) take contrapositive: ¬F → ¬E. (Contrapositive of E → F)

¬E → Sleep. (Premise)

From (2) and (3) by hypothetical syllogism (chain): ¬F → Sleep. (If ¬F then ¬E, if ¬E then Sleep; hence ¬F → Sleep.)

Sleep → R. (Premise)

From (4) and (5) by hypothetical syllogism: ¬F → R. ✔

Thus the premises entail: if I do not finish the program, then I will wake up feeling refreshed.
