1.In JavaScript the Promise object represents the eventual completion or the failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. In JS we use promises to work with asynchronous operations like sending a request to an endpoint. It provides methods then(), catch(), and finally() are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes settled.
2.In JavaScript a closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state, it’s lexical environment. In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

3. Code:
str1 = 'anagram'
str2 = 'naagram'

function areAnagrams(word1, word2) {
    array1 = [...word1].sort()
    array2 = [...word2].sort()
    return (array1.length === array2.length) && array1.every((value, index) => value === array2[index])
}

console.log(areAnagrams(str1, str2))
4. Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
undefined
This code showcases the difference between the block scope of let and function scope (in this case global) of var. Since let has block scope the console.log outputs the array values as expected as the index that is passed into the set timeout is of the correct value of i. But because of vars function scope by the time the log runs the I has the value of 10 which is out of range of the arrays indexes, which is the reason why the array b[i] returns undefined for every iteration.

5. Output:
outer func:  this.foo = bar
outer func:  self.foo = bar
inner func:  this.foo = undefined
inner func:  self.foo = bar
Why:
This code outputs the first two lines because of the fact that the first "func: function() " function's
this keyword points to the "myObject"'s this, so they have access to the foo variable. But the anonymous function's this keyword doesn't inherit the this keyword from my object and is instead pointing towards the wondow object, which doesn't have the foo keyword, so this.foo prints undefined. On the other hand self.foo prints "bar" because it sees the self variable from its parent scope.
6. Code
const urls = [
    'https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/',
    'https://swapi.dev/api/people/2/',
    'https://swapi.dev/api/people/3/',
];

function fetchInParallel(urls) {
    return Promise.all(urls.map(url => fetch(url).then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Failed to fetch ${url}: ${response.statusText}`);
        }
        return response.json();
    })));
}

fetchInParallel(urls)
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));

1.A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. It allows code to be executed after a task completes. This is especially useful for asynchronous operations like file reading, API requests, and timers.
2.The event loop is a core part of Node.js’s asynchronous architecture. It allows non-blocking I/O operations — such as reading files or handling network requests — by delegating tasks to the system and resuming execution when results are available.
3.
function countCharacters(text) {
  const result = {};
  for (let char of text) {
    char = char.toLowerCase(); // optional: make it case-insensitive
    if (result[char]) {
      result[char]++;
    } else {
      result[char] = 1;
   }
  }
  return result;
 }
  console.log(countCharacters("Hello World!"));

4.This demonstrates how the event loop and asynchronous callbacks like setTimeout behave in JavaScript — even with 0 milliseconds delay
5.The loop uses var, which is function-scoped.
When setTimeout runs, the i in the callback refers to the same i from the outer scope.
By the time the setTimeout callbacks execute, the loop has finished — so i === 5
